Hi! I am a master student in Machine Learning and Data Science at University of Southern California. Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in Xidian University in June 2021.

I am interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a particular interest in text generation, trustworthy AI models, and few-shot NLP.
